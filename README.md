A simple interpretive programming language.
============================
Paradigms:
---
- Simple and minimal. Mainly for writing algorithms.
- Indent-based block control. Statements terminated by newlines or ;
- Loosely typed.
- Object Oriented.

Testing:
---
`g++ src/interface.cpp -o src/exec`  
`./src/exec`  
Debug modes:- >2: print all messages, 1: print only log messages, 0: no debug messages. 

---
Basic Syntax
---
```python
# this is a comment
var x = 5
if x equals 5
    print ("Yaay it works")
else
    print ("Sorry, something fishy...")
    var y = 1
    if y equals 1
        print ("Got so far?")

```
Note: The project is still under development, but does support the basic features described above. Feel free to report any bugs.
